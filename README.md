# North Dine Web Application Project

### Brief Introduction to the North Dine Project

This is a full-stack web application representing (an imaginary) upper-middle class restaurant. It incorporates three main pages:

- Home Page: showing brief information about the restaurant and gives the user a taste of what to expect

- Menu Page: showcasing all the available menu items sorted into two categories - dishes and drinks

- Reservation Page: giving the user an overview of which food items they selected so far, and provides a submission form for the user to fill out and submit their entire order

### One thing about my Project which I am proud of...

I am currently a first year Computer Science student, I have never been exposed to or worked with frontend, backend, their related technologies and programming languages prior to entering the MSA programme. That being said, I am very proud of the project as a whole as it allowed me to truly learn and explore full-stack development for the first time ever, rather rapidly and quickly, but productively nonetheless. This is my first ever project (albeit created with the help of ChatGPT) but I am very proud of it as is :) Thank you very much for checking it out!
